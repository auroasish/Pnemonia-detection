# 🩺 Pneumonia Detection Using CNN on Chest X-Ray Images

This project uses a Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) to detect pneumonia from chest X-ray images. The model is trained using TensorFlow and Keras, and performs binary classification: identifying whether an X-ray is NORMAL or indicates PNEUMONIA.

## 📁 Dataset

The dataset used is the Chest X-Ray Images (Pneumonia) dataset available on [Kaggle](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/paultimothymooney/chest-xray-pneumonia).

It is divided into three folders:
- train/
- val/ (validation)
- test/

Each folder contains:
- NORMAL/ – images of healthy lungs
- PNEUMONIA/ – images with pneumonia

## 🧠 Project Workflow

### 1. 📊 Data Exploration & Visualization
- Count and display the number of images in each class.
- Display sample X-ray images from both categories to understand visual differences.

### 2. ⚙️ Data Preprocessing
- Use ImageDataGenerator for:
  - Normalizing pixel values
  - Real-time data augmentation (rotation, zoom, flip)

### 3. 🏗️ CNN Model Architecture
- 3 convolutional layers with ReLU activation and MaxPooling
- Flatten layer followed by Dense + Dropout
- Final Dense layer with sigmoid activation for binary classification

### 4. 🧪 Model Training & Evaluation
- Train the model using the training set
- Validate performance on the validation set
- Evaluate final accuracy and loss on the test set
- Plot training vs validation accuracy and loss
